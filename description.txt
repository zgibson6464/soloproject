I am hoping to create a chore tracking website. 
Living with roomates, it would be beneficial to use a tracking website to assign chores for the week, as well as track what chores have been done.

This would be utilizing code from the first stack that included HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask, and MySQL.

backlog: 
- add a comments section to each chore to describe anything worth mentioning. 
- create a 'house hold' section so more people could use and assign a household.
